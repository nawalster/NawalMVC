Learning MVC by building a very light custom framework from scratch using OO PHP that includes:
1. A core library class to load controllers & methods from the URL (using .htaccess).
2. A base controller class to load models and views.
3. A custom database library using PDO for all models to interact with the database using prepared statements.
 ***********
Future:
Build an application on top of it that includes full user authentication, server side form validation, Bootstrap 4, CRUD functionality, helper functions (flash messaging, redirects)
